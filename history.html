			<h2>HISTORY</h2>
			<p>You don’t need to be a history expert to be enchanted by the captivating legacy of fragrance. For millennia, perfume has served as a divine offering, a symbol of wealth, a tool of seduction, and a source of pleasure.<br/> Though its origins are lost to time, its story stretches from Ancient Egypt to Greece and Rome, where rosewater flowed in fountains, and to the opulent court of Louis XIV, who required a new scent every day.Modern perfumery emerged in the late 19th century with the invention of synthetic ingredients, giving rise to legendary houses like Coty, Guerlain, and Roger & Gallet.<br/> Coco Chanel’s No. 5 revolutionized perfume, establishing it as a luxury staple, while Estée Lauder’s Youth Dew in the 1950s made fragrance a daily indulgence rather than a rare treat.This fascinating history, spanning centuries and cultures, is an invitation to discover the enduring allure of perfume—an art form that continues to captivate and transform.</p>
